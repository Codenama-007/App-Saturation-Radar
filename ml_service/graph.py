    Competitive analysis (already determined):

    Rules:
    - Only reference competitors that were explicitly identified as similar
      products in the analysis above. Do NOT treat generic platforms, website
      builders, hosting providers, marketplaces, or design tools (e.g. Shopify,
      Wix, Hostinger, Dribbble, WooCommerce) as competitors unless the analysis
      above specifically named them as a directly competing PRODUCT.
    - If the analysis above says STATUS: NOT_FOUND, there are no real
      competitors to critique. In that case, skip "COMPETITOR GAPS" and instead
      suggest features based on common weaknesses in the relevant space
      generally rather than specific products.
    - If the analysis above lists real competitors, list what each one lacks
      ONLY if that's stated or clearly implied in the analysis — otherwise say
      "not enough information to tell."

    Then suggest 3-5 concrete, differentiating features for the user's idea.
    Each must map to a specific gap or, if NOT_FOUND, a specific pain point in
    this market. No generic "add AI" or "improve UX" suggestions.

    Format:
    COMPETITOR GAPS: (or "N/A — no direct competitors found" if STATUS: NOT_FOUND)
